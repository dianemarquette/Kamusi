## Semester Project at Kamusi (Fall 2020)

### Interfacing and expanding Kam4D, Kamusi’s graph database 

The project changed twice directions to adapt to the organization’s priorities and the resources at my disposal. 

My three key contributions to the project are:
- two scripts to extract words from a list of frequent terms that are unknown to Kam4D, Kamusi’s database (one without Verbiste and one with Verbiste)
- a CSV file with all the conjugated forms of 7'015 French verbs (using Verbiste) -> the script that I wrote to generate the CSV file was unfortunately lost after my computer suffered a liquid damage 
- a detailed report including how the current database public interface works and how more efficient queries leveraging the possibilities offered by Kam4D could improve it

Please refer to the report for a detailed synthesis of the work accomplished during the semester.
